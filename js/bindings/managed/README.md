# Managed Nanocodex agents

`nanocodex/managed` is the control-plane client for account-owned Nanocodex
agents. It is separate from local transports and from the Cloudflare Durable
Object adapter.

In a browser, authentication uses the current origin's HttpOnly account cookie:

```js
import { Agent } from "nanocodex/managed";

const agent = await Agent.create();
const turn = agent.turn.prompt({
  input: "Inspect the repository and summarize it.",
  idempotencyKey: crypto.randomUUID(),
});
const result = await turn.result();
console.log(result.finalMessage);
```

On a server, provide the managed origin and an `ncx_live_...` account API key:

```js
const agent = await Agent.get(process.env.NANOCODEX_AGENT_ID, {
  baseUrl: "https://nanocodex.example",
  apiKey: process.env.NANOCODEX_API_KEY,
});
```

`Agent.list()` returns agent handles, `agent.state()` reads current state, and
`agent.delete()` removes the agent and its retained state. `agent.events.watch`
is an async iterator over durable events. Pass its last decimal `cursor` to a
later watcher to resume strictly after the acknowledged event. Network endings
reconnect automatically from that cursor. Watchers and independently awaitable
turn results on one agent handle share one replayable event connection; each
subscriber keeps its own cursor, so consuming one never steals another's events.
Pass `cursor: "latest"` to attach atomically at the durable head without
replaying retained history; a history page can then hydrate independently.

Returning browser clients may use `Agent.open(id)` to construct a retained
handle without a preliminary state request. The first operation on that handle
still verifies account ownership at the managed service boundary. Use
`Agent.get(id)` when an eager existence check is part of the caller's workflow.

The managed API never accepts model-provider credentials, egress bindings,
runtime environment objects, credential grants, or arbitrary request headers.
